# Sudo Website Source Code
Hey there, you found the source code for [sudouc.club](https://sudouc.club/). Take a look around, its all Open Source.

## Development
To begin you'll need to install and configure a few dependencies & build tools:
 - [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).
 - [NodeJS & NPM]()

While developing, enable a livereload server with:
```shell
$ jekyll serve --livereload
```
and go to [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

Alternatively you can build the source once:
```shell
$ jekyll build
```
